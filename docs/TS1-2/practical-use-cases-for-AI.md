  - Trade-off between complexity and interpretability
  - Compliance requirements for transparency
  - Rule-based systems as alternatives

### AI vs. Rule-Based Systems:
  - Rule-based systems are deterministic
  - AI models are probabilistic
  - AI learns and adapts over time
  - AI incorporates randomness
  - Deterministic outputs require rule-based systems



## Types of ML

![alt text](types-of-ml.png)

The broad category of Machine learning are


- **Supervised Learning**
- **Unsupervised Learning**
- **Semi-supervised Learning**
- **Reinforcement Learning**

**Supervised Learning**
Supervised learning is a type of machine learning where the model is trained on labeled data. This means the input data is paired with the correct output, allowing the model to learn by comparing its predictions with the actual outcomes. It is further divided into two categories based on the type of target variable:

- **Continuous Target Variable**: When the target variable is continuous (numeric), regression algorithms are used. An example provided is predicting "Housing Price".
- **Categorical Target Variable**: When the target variable is categorical (belongs to a class or category), classification algorithms are employed. An example provided is "Medical Imaging".

**Unsupervised Learning**
Unsupervised learning deals with unlabeled data. The model tries to learn the patterns and structure from the input data without any explicit instructions on what to predict.

- **Target Variables are not available**: This indicates there are no labels for the data. Unsupervised learning can be broken down into:

  - **Clustering**: This technique groups similar data points together. An example is "Customer Segmentation".
  - **Association**: This technique finds rules that describe large portions of the data. An example is "Market classification analysis".

**Semi-supervised Learning**

Semi-supervised learning is a hybrid approach that uses a small amount of labeled data and a large amount of unlabeled data for training. This approach is beneficial when labeling data is expensive or time-consuming.

- **Categorical Target Variable**: Even though the target variable is categorical, not all the data points are labeled.

  - **Classification**: The model learns to classify data based on a mix of labeled and unlabeled data. An example given is "Text Classification".
  - **Clustering**: Similar to unsupervised learning, it also groups data, but with some initial labeled data points to guide the process. An example is "Lane Finding on GPS data".

**Reinforcement Learning**

Reinforcement learning is a type of machine learning where an agent learns to make decisions by performing actions in an environment to achieve maximum cumulative reward. It is unique because it focuses on learning the optimal behavior in a specific context, based on the rewards or punishments received.

- **Categorical Target Variable**: The actions can be seen as making classifications or decisions, which are then rewarded or punished.
  - **Classification**: In reinforcement learning, the decision-making process can be viewed as a classification problem where actions are categorized. An example provided is "Optimized Marketing".

- **Target Variable not available**: This indicates scenarios where the model must control the environment without specific target variables.
  - **Control**: Here, the model controls an environment directly to optimize certain behaviors or outcomes, such as in "Driverless Cars".



###  Use cases

Based on the provided text, here is a table summarizing the types of machine learning, their definitions, and use cases:
