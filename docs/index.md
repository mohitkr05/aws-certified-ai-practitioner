- Understand sources of ML models (for example, open source pre-trained
models, training custom models).
- Describe methods to use a model in production (for example, managed API
service, self-hosted API).
- Identify relevant AWS services and features for each stage of an ML pipeline
(for example, SageMaker, Amazon SageMaker Data Wrangler, Amazon
SageMaker Feature Store, Amazon SageMaker Model Monitor)
- Understand fundamental concepts of ML operations (MLOps) (for example,
experimentation, repeatable processes, scalable systems, managing
technical debt, achieving production readiness, model monitoring, model
re-training).
- Understand model performance metrics (for example, accuracy, Area Under
the ROC Curve [AUC], F1 score) and business metrics (for example, cost per
user, development costs, customer feedback, return on investment [ROI]) to
evaluate ML models
