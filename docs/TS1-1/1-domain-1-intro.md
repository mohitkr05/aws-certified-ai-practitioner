## Key terms

### Artificial Intelligence (AI)

The field of computer science dedicated to solving cognitive problems associated with human intelligence, such as learning, creation, and image recognition.

Goal: To create self-learning systems that derive meaning from data.

Examples: Alexa, ChatGPT, real-time fraud detection, repetitive task automation, pattern recognition, trend forecasting.

### Machine Learning (ML)

A branch of AI that focuses on using data and algorithms to imitate human learning.

Process: Gradually improves accuracy by training on large datasets to identify patterns and make predictions.

Example: Product recommendations.


### Deep Learning


Definition: A type of machine learning model inspired by human brains using layers of neural networks.

Capabilities: Recognizing human speech, objects, and images.


### AI Applications
    
- Healthcare: Reading X-rays and scans, predicting pandemics.
- Manufacturing: Monitoring assembly lines, predicting equipment maintenance.
- Customer Service: Chat and search systems, product recommendations.
- Business Efficiency: Demand forecasting, fraud detection, HR processes.
- Personalized Experiences: Content recommendations, targeted promotions.

### AI Techniques

- Regression Analysis: Predicting future values based on historical data.
- Anomaly Detection: Identifying deviations from expected patterns.
- Computer Vision: Processing images and videos for object identification, facial recognition, and more.
- Natural Language Processing (NLP): Understanding, interpreting, and generating human language.
- Generative AI: Creating original content like stories, images, and music.

### Key Terms

- Inference: A prediction made by an AI model.
- Anomaly: A deviation from the expected pattern.
- Prompt: A request or instruction given to a generative AI model.
